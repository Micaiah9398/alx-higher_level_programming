More Data Structures
This repository contains examples and explanations of various data structures beyond the basic data structures covered in most programming courses. These data structures are essential for solving complex programming problems and optimizing performance in real-world applications.
Introduction
Data structures are fundamental building blocks for programming. They are used to store and organize data in a way that enables efficient access and modification of that data. Basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and stacks are typically covered in most programming courses. However, more complex data structures such as trees, graphs, and heaps are essential for solving more complex problems.
